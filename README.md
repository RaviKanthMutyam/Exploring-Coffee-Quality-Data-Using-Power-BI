Project Overview :

The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) is a non-profit organization that works to improve the quality and value of coffee worldwide. It was founded in 1996 and has its headquarters in California, USA.
CQI's mission is to promote coffee quality through a range of activities that include research, training, and certification programs. The organization works with coffee growers, processors, roasters, and other stakeholders to improve coffee quality standards, promote sustainability, and support the development of the specialty coffee industry.


Objective: 

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the rich dataset provided by CQI to understand the factors that contribute to coffee quality. Specifically, we aim to explore the following research questions:

1.	What are the key determinants of coffee quality as evaluated through sensory attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.?

2.	Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?

3.	Can we identify any trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality?

4.	How do different variables interact to influence the Total Cup Points, which represent an overall measure of coffee quality?
